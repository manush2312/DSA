// Unique number of occurence
// given an array of integers, return "true" if the number of occureneces of each value in the array is unique otherwise false.
// example : arr[] = {1,2,2,1,1,3}
// here number of occurences of 1 --> 3, 2 --> 2, 3 --> 1, every element is occuring in unique manner so True.
// example arr[] = {1,2}, this is false because 1 is occuring only once and 2 in also occuring only once so no unique occurences.
